	<h1>About This Project</h1>
		<p> Hello! My name is Emily Douglas and I'm the creator of the Challenge Pack. While pursing my Master's in Design Science at the University of Michigan, I read a lot of literature related to design, creativity, and innovation. However, most of it was academic research and didn’t discuss how to apply the studied concepts and findings within an industry application. Therefore, I decided to design a tool to help bridge this gap and translate this research into something more tangible for the average person to use for my final capstone project. </p>

		<p> In order to do this, I decided to create a card deck that consolidated activities which utilize creativity enhancing principles grounded in academic research to help users build their creative thinking skills. </p>

	<h2>Design Process</h2>
	<h3>Information Gathering</h3>

	<p>I started by conducting a literature review of articles that had been shown to increase creativity. While some were found through my own search, I was fortunate to have access to many already collected by my project advisor, Colleen Seifert, who has studied creativity for many years now. The articles I ended up using are summarized below in the Creativity Concept Tables for those who are curious to learn more about the research this project is based upon.  </p>

	<h4>Table 2. Summary of other research articles used</h4>

	<p> After conducting this literature review, I gathered approximately forty different brainteasers and design challenges. While many were drawn from my own experiences, many were based on other classmates’ experiences and the internet. I then “audited” activities such to see what (if any) creativity enhancing concepts they utilized. </p>

	<h3>Designing the Cards</h3>
	<p>Most of my design decisions were centered around making the Challenge Pack user-friendly and something that potential users would be interested in engaging with, including connecting them with the research that I had come across to improve creativity during my academic studies.</p>

	<p>Early on in the project, I decided I wanted to create a tangible product in the form of a card deck. Not only are they small and portable, they are also a form factor that is unintimidating and something most people know how to interact with. I liked this, as I envisioned the deck initially to live in a breakroom and something that could be used when people needed a break from working. I later developed the user scope further, as the cards could also be used as a group ice breaker, during meetings to get brains warmed up, or in schools to help introduce students to engineering through design challenges. </p>

	<p>My next step in the design process was to decide what information to put on the cards and how to organize it. I decided to include instructions for how to do each activity, what materials are required, how many people are needed for the activity, and color coded them based on what creativity concepts are utilized. A key for the creativity concepts and their respective shape and color can be found below or within the card deck. In order to make the deck easy to use, I also wanted to consider how the users may search through the cards. To do this, I made sure to have the number of participants in the upper right hand corner, so users could easily flip through the deck to find an activity based on the number of participants required. I also wanted to list the materials required for each activity near the top of the card. This allows users to quickly see if they have the materials needed before taking the time to read the activity instructions. </p>

	<p>Finally, I decided to color code what creativity-enhancing concepts each activity was using. Based on my own visual design knowledge and feedback from a focus group with peers, I redundantly coded the various creativity concepts by using both shapes and colors that are colorblind friendly, making the deck more accessible. I decided to put this coding at the bottom of the card because, while I would love for every user to look into what research based creativity concepts they were practicing for each activity, I realize that many may not be interested in the actual research. If users are interested, they can still easily see it and learn more if desired. </p>
