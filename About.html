	<h2>Challenge Pack Card Deck</h2>
		<p>Originating from the disparity between academic literature and industry application on the topic of creativity enhancement, the Challenge Pack was created to help bridge this gap and provide an opportunity for those outside academia to build their creativity and creative thinking skills. </p>

		<p>The card deck has a variety of activities classified under two different categories: Design Challenges and Brainteasers. In order to quickly determine the activity type, the cards are outlined in different colors. Light green is for a design challenge, blue is for a brainteaser, and gray is for information cards such as answer and creativity concept keys. If you would like to learn about other design decisions, development process, or academic literature in which the Challenge Pack is based upon, feel free to check out the About This Project tab above.</p>
